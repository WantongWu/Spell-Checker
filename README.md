Use SpellChecker.java to check spelling of a word, several words, or a file based on the dictionary imported ("words.txt"). 
SpellChecker class operates in two possible modes: In command-line mode it provides explicit feedback on the spelling of specific words. In file scanning mode it takes input from a file (input redirection) and print messages only for words that are not spelled correctly.
