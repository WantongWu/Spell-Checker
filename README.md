The thing that I learned most from this assignment is probably using string methods and the input redirection. The multiple ways of creating near misses definitely challenged the understanding of both string methods and for-loop. I didn't know there are input and output redirection before, also I didn't know the deeper meaning of the main function parameter String[] args. This assignment deepens my understanding on both.

The largest problem I have encountered was figuring out how the input direction work. I searched for several websites and checked the instruction linked in the Instructions. It is mostly like an automatic input.

The Kudos part is very interesting. I thought that the ArrayList could be slower than HashSet. But I didn't expect that it was THIS slow. HashSet version took 0.158 sec to finish the search through the dictionary, whilst SimpleSet (fundamentally ArrayList) version took 17.815 secs. I tested several times, the SimpleSet running time was between 16 to 20 secs. That was more than 100 times difference. It may be because that (I'm just guessing) elements in HashSet already have a home row (ideally) so the search could happen very close to where the elements are. But for an ArrayList, each search may need to go through all the elements before the wanted one.
